                <p>Blogging is far from dead. As the last two years of X-formerly-Twitter drama has shown, allowing a
                    social media platform to control your access to your audience has big risks. If you want a platform
                    where you can share your thoughts properly and keep control of things, it's impossible to beat a
                    blog. Plus, you can always share your blog posts on social media, through a newsletter,
                    and anywhere else. The whole point of a blog is that it's your content to do with as you will.</p>
                <div class="addmaincontainer">
                    <div>
                        <div class="addcontainer">
                            <h3>Promote and publish your content with automation</h3>
                            <a class="btn" href="#">Learn how</a>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Similarly, if you run a business and want to provide resources and recommendations to
                            customers,
                            the best way to do it is often to add a blog to your website. Best of all, your blog content
                            gets indexed by
                            Google—unlike almost all social media posts—so you can drive potential customers to your
                            business through content
                            marketing (and without having to pay for ads). Look at the blog you're reading right now:
                            Zapier blog posts get millions of
                            views per month and are one of the most valuable ways of getting new customers at Zapier.

                </div>
                <p>
                    After testing all the most popular blog sites out there, these are the five best. And yes, two
                    of them are WordPress, but
                    there are a few great WordPress alternatives in here too.
